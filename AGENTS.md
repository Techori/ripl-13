- Preserve the target TanStack runtime configuration when importing source; source pages live in routes and reusable presentation in frontend.
- Keep public verification presentation separate from the authenticated team directory; verification results must not require directory access.
- Record verification changes with database triggers and public attempts server-side in an append-only admin-readable audit table; never store submitted codes, email addresses or phone numbers in audit events.
- Keep imported media as Lovable Assets pointers and generated media as bundled ES imports, so media remains available independently of the source project.
- Scope Funding Programme design tokens and controls to its page to preserve other imported page designs; the original programme page and the separate investment page share opportunity amounts from the rules module so both stay consistent.
- Preserve original IDs when importing future user records; verified identity mapping must control access, never client-submitted roles.
- Keep programme calculation rules in a browser-safe module with concrete unit tests so registration terms remain consistent.
- Removed startup offerings have no public route or root promotion; retain only internal historical records and browser-safe calculation rules so removing public access never destroys stored data.
- Retired offering URLs use unconditional not-found guards in both preview and production; legal presentation excludes retired programme clauses while retaining the original source documents for historical records.
- Keep summit registration presentation separate from the retained internal application form; external registration replacements must preserve the existing form for later reuse.
- Keep team authentication on Cloud Auth with password sign-in and email+password signup (no email OTP or sign-in links); new accounts need admin approval; password reset uses a public recovery-link page, because emailed sign-in links proved unreliable and Cloud stores password hashes.
- Grant the first Super Admin role only after the fixed owner email is verified server-side, because client-supplied identity or roles must never authorize access.
- Public store network figures come from the admin-managed store_network table (visible rows with stores > 0); the bundled JSON is only a pre-load fallback, so keep its default hidden-state filter in sync.
- media-library/ holds optimized image copies including older extras; refresh it when images change. A Vite-only tooling plugin serves these copies for pointer URLs and allowlisted /media-library/ URLs on localhost, while published pages retain CDN pointers; this avoids preview-host dependence without putting filesystem logic in the Worker.
